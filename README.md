The Baxter Algorithms is a software package for tracking and analysis of cells in microscope images. The software can handle images produced using both 2D transmission microscopy and 2D or 3D fluorescence microscopy. The software has shown outstanding performance compared to other software in the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenges of 2013, 2014, and 2015. In addition to cell tracking, the Baxter Algorithms can perform automated analysis of myoblast fusion and automated analysis of fluorescent histological sections of muscle tissue. The software is written in MATLAB, but it also contains some algorithms written in C++, which are compiled into mex-files.

The software is started by running the file BaxterAlgorithms.m in MATLAB. For users without a MATLAB license, it is also possible to download deployed versions for 64-bit Windows and 64-bit Mac by pressing the release tab and expanding the assets dropdown under the latest release. Further instructions on how to use the software can be found in UserGuide.pdf, which is located in the folder UserGuide. There are also video tutorials in the YouTube playlist https://tinyurl.com/ba-tutorials.

The file RunBaxterAlgorithms_ISBI_2021.m can be used to reproduce the results in the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge 2021. The bat-files with names in the format [dataset]-[sequence index]-[configuration].bat, where [sequence index] is either 01 or 02 and [configuration] is GT, ST, GT+ST, allGT, allST or allGT+allST, generate the results for the primary track. The bat-files with names in the format [dataset]-[sequence index].bat generate results for the secondary track.

The file Train.m can be used to reproduce the training of segmentation parameters for the primary track of the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge 2021. The bat-files with names in the format Train-[dataset]-[configuration].bat reproduce the training for a specific dataset and training data configuration. The bat-files with names in the format Train-[configuration].bat reproduce the joint training over all datasets in the training data configurations allGT, allST and allGT+allST. The settings are saved to csv-files in one of the folders CTC2021_trained_on_GT, CTC2021_trained_on_ST, CTC2021_trained_on_GT_plus_ST, CTC2021_trained_on_GT_all, CTC2021_trained_on_ST_all and CTC2021_trained_on_GT_plus_ST_all in Files\Settings. The csv-files are given the same names as the existing csv-files for the training data, but '_new' is added as a suffix.

To run tracking or training using bat-files, the dataset folder must be placed next to the SW-folder (the top folder of the git-repository).

To apply the training procedure used in the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge 2021 on new data, do the following:
   1. Place the folder with training data next to the top folder of the git-repository.
   2. Go to the folder Files\Settings\CTC2021_clean and create clean settings files for all image sequences, by copying the settings files for one of the image sequences in the cell tracking challenge. Edit the copied settings files by changing numZ to the number of z-planes, bits to the number of camera bits, voxelHeight to the ratio between the voxel height and the voxel width, foiErosion to the minimum distance in pixels that an object has to extend into the image from the image boundary to be segmented, and SegGbRamPerFrameCTC to the number of GB of RAM needed to segment one frame. The names of the files should be Settings_ISBI_2021_Training_[dataset]-[sequence index]_clean.csv.
   3. Run Train.m with the name of the dataset as the first input and the desired training data configuration as the second input.
   4. Go to CTC2021_trained_on_GT, CTC2021_trained_on_ST, CTC2021_trained_on_GT_plus_ST, CTC2021_trained_on_GT_all, CTC2021_trained_on_ST_all or CTC2021_trained_on_GT_plus_ST_all in Files\Settings and locate the generated settings files. The generated files will have the suffix '_new'. Remove the suffix '_new' and replace 'Training' by 'Challenge' in the file name. Edit the numZ parameter if the number of z-planes is not the same in the challenge data as in the training data.
   5. Replace the training data folder with the challenge data folder.
   6. Call RunBaxterAlgorithms_ISBI_2021.m in the same way as in the existing bat-files for the primary track.
